    "text": "Overview\nAirbnb is one of the most visited rental applications. According to relevant statistics, it’s estimated that Airbnb has more than 20% market share in the rental industry until 2023 and the average revenue of hosts annually is $13,800[Reference]. For landlords, understanding pricing patterns and the factors that influence prices is an effective way to increase revenue. In our project, we aim to identify potential pricing and revenue-related characteristics from listing information throughout the United States. At the same time, it is very intriguing to see what amenities are most widely offered by tenants because travelers’ requirements for living conditions are gradually increasing despite being in a short-stay residence. To some extent, the most widely provided amenities denote the minimum standard of amenities in the listing.\n\n\n\nThe Data\n\n\n\nThe data we use comes from the website named Inside Airbnb [Link to data source] where archives scraped data on Airbnb. All the data contains mainly two aspects. One of them is the detailed descriptions of existing listings in 33 cities in the United States, including features like latitude, longitude, room types, and rating of different aspects. The other dataset records the price and availability during the next 30, 60, 90, and 365 days. After joining the two datasets together, the future expected revenue for each listing can be calculated by using the unit price one night and the number of available nights."

Firstly, revenue tends to increase significantly from Friday to Sunday and is at its lowest on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Additionally, August and September have relatively low reservation rates compared to other months.\nMost of the Airbnb listings in North Carolina are private rooms and entire home/apartment types, with the majority of revenue coming from entire home/apartment rentals. It’s not surprising that Hotel Room and Shared room types have lower revenues. The booking patterns for private rooms and entire home/apts differ based on the month. For private rooms, revenue tends to decrease from April to May, increase from mid-June, and further increase from mid-September. On the other hand, for entire home/apts, bookings decrease until mid-September.\nTo increase revenue, households can adjust their pricing strategies by increasing prices during weekends, and decreasing them during weekdays to attract more travelers and increase occupancy rates, matching the booking patterns. Private room households may consider raising their prices after mid-July when booking rates tend to increase. For entire home/apt listings, households may consider converting them to rent private rooms inside the apartment/house instead of renting the entire space, as demand for entire home/apt bookings decreases until mid-September."

One of the key findings is that some listings with higher prices and fewer reviews generate more revenue, likely due to having more beds available. However, for most listings with 0-100 reviews, increasing the number of reviews does not necessarily lead to higher revenue, especially for those with fewer beds.\nThe scatterplot chart also reveals that most listings in North Carolina have review scores higher than 4.5, and higher review scores tend to generate higher revenue. This indicates that hosts should prioritize providing top-notch services to guests to receive positive reviews, which can ultimately boost their revenue. By maintaining high-quality services and keeping guests happy, hosts can improve their review scores and increase their revenue in the long run."
